ChangeLog
============

+ Added Close/CloseAck Packet

Reason: I previously thought only one file is allowed for the whole session.
So Close can be implemented as a wrapper for Commit().
Later on, I realized my assumption were not true. 
Therefore Close() and CloseAck() are needed.

+ Changed timeout from 1 sec to 8 sec

Reason: With 5 servers and 20% droprate, the 1 second timeout
seems a bit tight. 
Increasing it to 4 sec improves success rate for the interface.
