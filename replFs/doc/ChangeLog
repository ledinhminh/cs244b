ChangeLog
============

+ Added CloseAck Packet and its timeout
Reason: I previously thought Close had the same return semantics as Abort().
Since Abort() cannot fail when server is down, I did not include Acks
for Close() as well.

+ Changed timeout from 1 sec to 4 sec
Reason: After testing with 5 servers and 20% droprate, the 1 second timeout
seems a bit tight. Increasing it to 4 sec improves stability.
